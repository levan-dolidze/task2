 <p id = "maintitle">Listen, All You New Yorkers</p>
 

 <p class ="text">  Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten
    From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
    Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin
    Black, White, New York you make it happen
    
    Brownstones, water towers, trees, skyscrapers
    Writers, prize fighters and Wall Street traders
    We come together on the subway cars
    Diversity unified, whoever you are
    We're doing fine on the One and Nine line
    On the L we're doin' swell
    On the number Ten bus we fight and fuss
    Cause we're thorough in the boroughs and that's a must
    I remember when the Deuce was all porno flicks
    Running home after school to play PIXX
    At lunch I'd go to Blimpies down on Montague Street
    And hit the Fulton Street Mall for the sneakers on my feet
    Dear New York, I hope you're doing well
    I know a lot's happened and you've been through hell
    So, we give thanks for providing a home
    Through your gates at Ellis Island we passed in droves.  </p>
